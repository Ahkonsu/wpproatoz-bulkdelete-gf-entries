Overview
--------
This plugin allows WordPress administrators to bulk delete entries from a specific Gravity Forms form. It’s designed to handle large volumes of entries (e.g., spam cleanup) with customizable settings, real-time progress tracking, a stop option, dry run simulation, and detailed logging. The tool ensures reliable performance even with thousands of entries.

Requirements
------------
- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- PHP 8.0 or higher
- Gravity Forms plugin (active)

Installation
------------
1. Download the plugin zip file from WPProAtoZ.com or GitHub.
2. In your WordPress admin, go to Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin.
3. Upload the zip file and click "Install Now."
4. Activate the plugin.
5. Ensure Gravity Forms is installed and active.

How to Use
----------
1. **Access the Tool**
   - Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard as an administrator.
   - Navigate to **Settings > GF Bulk Delete**.

2. **Configure Settings**
   - **Select Form**: Choose the Gravity Form to delete entries from using the dropdown menu. The form title and ID are displayed for clarity.
   - **Batch Size**: Set the number of entries to process per batch (default: 250). Lower this for slower servers to avoid timeouts.
   - **Pause Time (seconds)**: Define the pause between batches in seconds (default: 15). Increase this if your server experiences high load or timeouts.
   - **Entry Status to Delete**: Check the boxes for Active, Spam, and/or Trash entries to include them in the deletion. At least one must be selected.
   - **Dry Run Mode**: Enable this (checkbox) to simulate the deletion without removing entries, useful for testing settings.
   - Click **Save Settings** to store your preferences.

3. **Preview Entry Count**
   - After selecting a form, the "Total Entries to Delete" will display below the settings, showing how many entries match your chosen statuses.

4. **Run the Bulk Delete**
   - Below the settings, click **Run Bulk Delete Now**.
   - A confirmation prompt will appear: "Are you sure you want to [delete entries/simulate deletion for] "[Form Title]"? This cannot be undone (Dry Run mode is [enabled/disabled])." Click OK to proceed.
   - The process starts, showing "Starting bulk delete..." followed by real-time updates like "Deleted: 250 / 5000 (5%) - Remaining: 4750" (or "Would Delete" in dry run mode).
   - A green progress bar fills as entries are processed.

5. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch the progress text and bar for updates on deleted entries, total count, percentage complete, and entries remaining.
   - The process runs in batches, pausing between each based on your settings.
   - A spinning loader indicates the process is active.

6. **Stop the Process (Optional)**
   - Once started, a **Stop Bulk Delete** button appears.
   - Click it and confirm to halt after the current batch. You’ll see "Stopping after current batch..." then "Stopped by user" when it ends.

7. **Reset Settings (Optional)**
   - Click **Reset to Defaults** to revert all settings to their defaults (e.g., batch size 250, pause time 15, active status only).
   - Confirm the action, and the page will reload with default settings applied.

8. **View Logs**
   - Switch to the "Logs" tab to see a detailed history of actions, including start/stop times, deleted entries, and any errors.

9. **Completion**
   - When finished, you’ll see "Bulk [delete/simulation] completed!" and the UI resets, allowing you to start again if needed.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- **Nothing Happens on Start/Reset**: Check your browser console (F12 > Console) for errors like "wpproatoz_gf_ajax is not defined." Clear cache and ensure scripts load (see logs).
- **Slow Performance or Timeouts**: Reduce batch size (e.g., 100) or increase pause time (e.g., 30 seconds) in settings.
- **Premature Stop**: If it stops immediately with "Stopped by user," ensure no residual stop flag exists (cleared on fresh runs).
- **Errors**: Common messages include:
  - "Gravity Forms not active": Install/activate Gravity Forms.
  - "No form selected": Choose a form in the settings.
  - "AJAX Error": Check server logs or contact your host if network issues persist. Look for retry messages in the UI (e.g., "Retrying 1/3").
- **Logs Missing**: Ensure the plugin directory is writable for `bulk-delete-log.txt`.

Notes
-----
- Always back up your database before running bulk deletes.
- This plugin only affects the selected form’s entries, leaving other forms untouched.
- Deletion is permanent unless in Dry Run mode—there’s no undo option.
- Logs are stored in `bulk-delete-log.txt` in the plugin directory for auditing.
